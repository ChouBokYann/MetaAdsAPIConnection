# MetaAdsAPIConnection
Connection between Facebook Ads reporting API and Google sheets

Problem: 

Operational demands require advertisement expenditure to be reported daily without the need for manual data logging. The data comes from many different platforms, of which one is Meta ads.

Solution:

As such, to be able to connect the Meta ads to a google sheet database for easier data connection, the pipeline was built on the Insights API to extract ad spend and other related information.
